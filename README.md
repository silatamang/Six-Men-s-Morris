Six Men's Morris, also known as Mill or Merels, is a two-player strategy game that has been played for centuries. The game is played on a board consisting of a grid of three concentric squares connected by lines at the midpoints of each side, creating 24 intersection points where the lines meet.

At the beginning of the game, each player has nine pieces, which are typically round disks or stones of contrasting colors. The players take turns placing their pieces on the board, one at a time, at the intersection points.

The goal of the game is to form a line of three pieces of the same color along any of the lines on the board. When a player forms a line of three, they may remove one of their opponent's pieces from the board. The player with fewer than three pieces left on the board at any point in the game loses.

Once all nine pieces have been placed, players take turns moving their pieces to adjacent intersection points along the lines on the board. This continues until one player is reduced to two pieces, at which point they may move their pieces to any open intersection points on the board.

The game can also be won by trapping the opponent's pieces so that they cannot make a legal move. This can be achieved by creating "mills" - three pieces of the same color in a row, either horizontally or vertically.

Overall, Six Men's Morris is a game of strategy and planning, requiring players to think ahead and anticipate their opponent's moves. It is a popular and challenging game that has stood the test of time.
